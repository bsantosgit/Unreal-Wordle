## About

The game is inspired by Wordle, a web-based word game by [Josh Wardle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle). The original was inspired by color matching game Mastermind.

The entire project was made using Unreal Engine's C++ and Blueprints working in Compatibility. While most of the Logic and Handling is in C++, UI Design and Animations were made using Blueprints for ease to handle.
